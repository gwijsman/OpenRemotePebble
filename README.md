Warning this is a very initial attempt to use my brand new pebble time to control my lights at home.
I have an OpenRemote server in place that (in my case) controls an x10 home automation system.
My attempt is to create a generic app for the pebble that reads a panel from the OpenRemote server.
By now this panels is very very limited in options.

I use the Pebble.js framework. Thanks to the initial creators!
